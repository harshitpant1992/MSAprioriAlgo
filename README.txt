Intructions to run the project:

1. Install Python 3.6 environment since the project has been done in Python 3.6
2. Place the input-data.txt, parameter-file.txt, output-patterns.txt in the same folder as MSApriori_HarshitPant_AbhishekRanjan.py
3. Either open the python file in an IDE and Run it there OR go to the directory path in cmd and type "python MSApriori_AbhishekRanjan_HarshitPant.py"
4. This will run the MSApriori_HarshitPant_AbhishekRanjan.py that has the MSApriori implementation and will populate the output-patterns.txt with the desired output



NOTE:
The structure of the text in parameter-file.txt should be strictly enforced. That is, there should be MIS() values, SDC, cannot_be_together:,must-have:. 
The corresponding values for them could be empty but they(i.e., the string) should be present.
